Letâ€™s try to populate our dp[] array from the above solution, working in the bottom-up fashion. As we saw in the above code, we were trying to find the minimum jumps needed to reach every index (if it is within the range) from the current index. We can use this fact to populate our array.
Time: O(N^2)
