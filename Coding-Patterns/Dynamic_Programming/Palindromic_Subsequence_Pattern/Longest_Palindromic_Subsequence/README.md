Problem Statement
Given a sequence, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS). In a palindromic subsequence, elements read the same backward and forward.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:

Input: "abdbca"
Output: 5
Explanation: LPS is "abdba".
