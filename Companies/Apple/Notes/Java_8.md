Extensive use of git.
Familiarity with gradle and maven package manager.
Experience in Test Driven Development.
Understanding of concurrency and multi-threaded programming concepts



Web technologies with proficiency in the Java popular open source frameworks

Candidate must have a deep knowledge of OO concepts and design patterns. 
Strong familiarity of deploying large-scale Java RPC applications is important.


**Java** **(OpenJDK Amazon Corretto 8)**

1. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems.
2. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode; that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the computer architecture.

**Proficient in core Java 8+**

1. Java SE 7: CodeName **Dolphin** :::::::::::::::::::::: Java SE 8: CodeName **Spider**

2. Java SE 8 brings the most anticipated feature for the programming language called **Lambda Expressions**, a new language feature which allows users to code local functions as method arguments.

3. Java 8 brings its own new specialized API for Date and Time manipulation.

4. Java SE 8 supports a new and improved JavaScript engine, Nashorn. It allows developers to run the script on a JVM. The idea was to implement a lightweight JavaScript runtime in the programming language with a native JVM.

**Java 8+ Features** https://www.journaldev.com/2389/java-8-features-with-examples

1. forEach() method in Iterable interface:
    Whenever we need to traverse through a Collection, we need to create an Iterator whose whole purpose is to iterate over and then we have business logic in a loop for each of the elements in the Collection. **Java 8 has introduced forEach method in java.lang.Iterable interface**
2. default and static methods in Interfaces
3. Collection API improvements
    ConcurrentHashMap compute(), forEach(), forEachEntry(), forEachKey(), forEachValue(), merge(), reduce() and search() methods.
    CompletableFuture that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status).
    Executors newWorkStealingPool() method to create a work-stealing thread pool using all available processors as its target parallelism level.

**Java-based web frameworks:** 

**Jetty**

1. Java HTTP (Web) server and Java Servlet container.
2. While Web Servers are usually associated with serving documents to people, Jetty is now often used for machine to machine communications, usually within larger software frameworks.

**Spring 4+**

Proficient with modern JVM-based micro-services frameworks

**Jetty Vs. Nginx**
Jetty: Lightweight, Very Fast, Embeddable, Scalable Thin.
Nginx: High performance http server, Performance, Easy to configure, Open source, Load balancer.

NGINX is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server.
Apache Tomcat is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies.

Jetty
Of course, some of you may want to use the Jetty embedded servlet container. Jettyâ€™s a fine choice, as well. You can simply exclude the Spring Boot starter Tomcat module and then import the Spring Boot Starter Jetty module. Spring Boot will automatically delegate to that, instead.
