Azure Interview experience

https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/477195/microsoft-azure-interview-loop-concurrency

The loop was very straight-forward. I had 4 interview questions, all of them mixed with behavioral and a coding/problem solving question.

1. Reverse a Linkedlist.
2. Given a bag of 100 balls, generate a sequence of draws from the bag. (Basicallty, shuffle an array 1..100).
3. Design LRU Cache.
4. Write an openFile(), that will interact with a File System open() function and minimize the number of times files are opened. Closing the files was not important for the scope of the interview.

In each of the interview, I was asked to make the process thread-safe. A topic I had never had to think about while preparing on LC. Needless to say, I tanked one interview but was able to tell the other interviewers how I could make my solution threadsafe.

Please do this https://leetcode.com/problemset/concurrency/ before you appear at Microsoft. Their questions maybe simple but the concurrency googly can really bite you in the ass, if you dont prepare this seemingly innocent topic.

Thank you for the read.
