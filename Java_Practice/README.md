# Java String Object (Non-primitive data type)
* String is ```Immutable``` because String objects are cached in ```String pool```.<br/>
Note: CACHED String Literals are shared between multiple clients (Risk: One client's action would affect all other client)
*



# Java Memory Management: (STACK and HEAP)
* ```Local Primitive Variables``` & ```References to object``` (i.e. variable declared in method) are stored in STACK. 
* ```All Objects``` are stored in HEAP.
* Local variables are stored on the stack.(```VARIABLES``` are a reference to the ```OBJECT```)
