### Dynamic Programming:


Two main strategies for dynamic programming:

Memoization (top down)

Tabulation (bottom up)


Memoization:
This optimizes recursive algorithms. You know you can use this when you can identify overlapping subproblems. It is a top down approach.

Tabulation:
This optimizes iterative algorithms and often uses a tabular data structure. You know you can use this when tracking solutions to smaller subproblems leads to solving larger problems. This is a bottom up approach.
