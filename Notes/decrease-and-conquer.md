### Decrease and Conquer:
* reduces a problem into a single smaller subproblem..
* reduction can be by a constant value or a constant factor.
* implemented with a **while** loop or **SINGLE** recursion.
  * Binary Search
  * Quickselect
  * Russian Peasant Multiplication
**Note:** Decrease and conquer includes reduction by a constant value (subtract by a value), however we will focus on reduction by a factor (division by a factor).
#### Example : Binary Search
#####  Time: O(logN) Space: O(1)
```

```

#### Example : Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
#####  Time: O(logN) Space: O(1)
```

```
#### Example : Number of Ones in a Sorted Bit Array
#####  Time: O(logN) Space: O(1)
```
