# Brute-force approach: 
* Less logical errors
* Sacrifice Time complexity for simplicity
# Broad and Specific Techniques:
* Efficient solutions
  ## Broad techniques:
  1. Divide and Conquer
  2. Dynamic Programming
  ## Specific techniques:
  1. Multiple pointers
  2. Frequency Count

### Multiple pointers:
* Arrays, Lists and Strings [force us at times to use more than 1 pointer]
    * Pointers vary in speed or a different startIndex; when we have to swap
Example : Sort a Bit Array
